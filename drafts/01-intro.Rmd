<!-- # Introduction -->

In recent years, there has been a demographic shift towards an aged population in all countries, and this trend is expected to continue. Considering the increase in the median population age and the prevalence of ageing-related diseases, understanding the molecular nature of ageing and ageing-related health outcomes is becoming a particular interest in the research community. 

Ageing is suggested to be a complex state with many contributors. Thus, collecting information from different components (both genetic and environmental) is crucial. Today, there are multiple relevant data sources that we can utilize (Table 1) in order to understand the link between ageing and ageing-related diseases and to prioritize drugs with a potential to improve health during ageing.
