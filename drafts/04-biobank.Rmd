# Ageing and diseases

<!-- ## Introduction -->

<!-- ### Healthspan -->

<!-- ### GWAS for complex diseases and challenges -->

<!-- ### The link between ageing and diseases -->

<!-- #### Previous studies (examples of disease-based studies) -->

<!-- #### Computational studies and systemic reviews including multiple diseases -->

<!-- ### Research Objectives -->

<!-- ## Methods -->

<!-- ## Results -->

<!-- ### Disease-disease relationships -->

<!-- #### Disease hierarchy -->

<!-- #### Disease co-occurrence -->

<!-- #### Disease age-of-onset -->

<!-- #### Genetic similarities -->

<!-- ### Defining the common genetic component for ageing-related diseases (ARDs) -->

<!-- #### Relevance to ageing  -->

<!-- #### Functional analysis -->

<!-- #### Drug repurposing -->

<!-- #### Evolutionary analysis -->

<!-- ## Discussion -->

<!-- ### Diseases of the same age of onset share similarity -->

<!-- ### Minimal overlap with the genes discovered in model organisms -->

<!-- ### Biological functions associated with ARDs -->

<!-- ### Main groups of drugs: anti-cancer (potentially senolytics), anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory drugs -->

<!-- ### Indications of mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories of ageing -->

<!-- ### Limitations in this work -->

<!-- ## Future Perspectives -->
