  abstract = "One of the most pressing challenges in genomic medicine is to
              understand the role played by genetic variation in health and
              disease. Thanks to the exploration of genomic variants at large
              scale, hundreds of thousands of disease-associated loci have been
              uncovered. However, the identification of variants of clinical
              relevance is a significant challenge that requires comprehensive
              interrogation of previous knowledge and linkage to new
              experimental results. To assist in this complex task, we created
              DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/), a knowledge management
              platform integrating and standardizing data about disease
              associated genes and variants from multiple sources, including
              the scientific literature. DisGeNET covers the full spectrum of
              human diseases as well as normal and abnormal traits. The current
              release covers more than 24 000 diseases and traits, 17 000 genes
              and 117 000 genomic variants. The latest developments of DisGeNET
              include new sources of data, novel data attributes and
              prioritization metrics, a redesigned web interface and recently
              launched APIs. Thanks to the data standardization, the
              combination of expert curated information with data automatically
              mined from the scientific literature, and a suite of tools for
              accessing its publicly available data, DisGeNET is an
              interoperable resource supporting a variety of applications in
              genomic medicine and drug R\&D.",

  abstract = "Shared aetiopathogenic factors among immune-mediated diseases
              have long been suggested by their co-familiality and
              co-occurrence, and molecular support has been provided by
              analysis of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes and
              genome-wide association studies. The interrelationships can now
              be better appreciated following the genotyping of large immune
              disease sample sets on a shared SNP array: the 'Immunochip'.
              Here, we systematically analyse loci shared among major
              immune-mediated diseases. This reveals that several diseases
              share multiple susceptibility loci, but there are many nuances.
              The most associated variant at a given locus frequently differs
              and, even when shared, the same allele often has opposite
              associations. Interestingly, risk alleles conferring the largest
              effect sizes are usually disease-specific. These factors help to
              explain why early evidence of extensive 'sharing' is not always
              reflected in epidemiological overlap.",

  abstract = "UniChem is a freely available compound identifier mapping service
              on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which
              structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between
              chemistry-based resources. In the past, the creation and
              maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several
              chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts
              by each of the separate teams. These efforts were complicated by
              the different data models, release schedules, and differing
              business rules for compound normalization and identifier
              nomenclature that exist across the organization. UniChem, a
              large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with
              pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from
              all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of
              efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these
              links. Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to
              and from all other sources are automatically calculated and
              immediately available for all to use. Updated mappings are
              immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the
              sources. Web services in UniChem provide users with a single
              simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their
              resource to all other sources represented in UniChem. In
              addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage
              allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which
              are obsolete. Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to
              allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort.
              Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI
              has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider
              selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra
              cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for
              external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.",

  abstract = "Senescence has long been a public health challenge as well as a
              fascinating evolutionary problem. There is neither a universally
              accepted theory for its ultimate causes, nor a consensus about
              what may be its impact on human health. Here we test the
              predictions of two evolutionary explanations of
              senescence-mutation accumulation and antagonistic
              pleiotropy-which postulate that genetic variants with harmful
              effects in old ages can be tolerated, or even favoured, by
              natural selection at early ages. Using data from genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS), we study the effects of genetic
              variants associated with diseases appearing at different periods
              in life, when they are expected to have different impacts on
              fitness. Data fit theoretical expectations. Namely, we observe
              higher risk allele frequencies combined with large effect sizes
              for late-onset diseases, and detect a significant excess of
              early-late antagonistically pleiotropic variants that,
              strikingly, tend to be harboured by genes related to ageing.
              Beyond providing systematic, genome-wide evidence for
              evolutionary theories of senescence in our species and
              contributing to the long-standing question of whether senescence
              is the result of adaptation, our approach reveals relationships
              between previously unrelated pathologies, potentially
              contributing to tackling the problem of an ageing population.",

              the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls
              in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder,
              autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply
              univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic
              variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs
              explained 17-29\% of the variance in liability. The genetic
              correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between
              schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 $\pm$ 0.04 s.e.),
              moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder
              (0.43 $\pm$ 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive
              disorder (0.47 $\pm$ 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive
              disorder (0.32 $\pm$ 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and
              ASD (0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of
              disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the
              negative control of Crohn's disease. This empirical evidence of
              shared genetic etiology for psychiatric disorders can inform

               inheritance has removed the necessity for postulating mechanisms
               for the extensive origination and control of mutations, since on
               the latter theory as compared to the former the random decay of
               variability (the raw material of evolution) is insignificant;
               the strategic point in evolutionary control is therefore in
               natural selection rather than mutation. The rate of increase of
               fitness to survive (as measured by survival) is equal to the
               genetic component of the variance; the larger the change
               introduced by a mutant, or the closer the adaptation, the
               smaller will be the chance of improvement; changes in the
               environment must also be taken into account. Dominance is
               regarded as having arisen from the selective influence of
               modifying factors. Mutant genes which are not wiped out
               fortuitously or by adverse selection within the first few
               generations have an excellent chance of establishing themselves,
               even with very small advantages and low mutation rates. Sexual
               selection may be of great importance, under favorable
               circumstances, in aiding the fission of species. Mimicry

               adaptation. In man differential fertility is the principal
               menace to the species, and appears to be due to (1) the
               inheritance of fertility, and (2) the social promotion of the

              Such expression reversals could imply loss of cellular identity
              in the aging brain, and provide a link between aging-related
              molecular changes and functional decline. Here we analyzed 19
              brain transcriptome age-series datasets, comprising 17 diverse
              brain regions, to investigate the ubiquity and functional
              properties of expression reversal in the human brain. Across all
              19 datasets, 25 genes were consistently up-regulated during
              postnatal development and down-regulated in aging, displaying an
              ``up-down'' pattern that was significant as determined by random
              permutations. In addition, 113 biological processes, including
              neuronal and synaptic functions, were consistently associated
              with genes showing an up-down tendency among all datasets. Genes

              genes involved in inflammation, extracellular matrix and lipid
              metabolism. We also identified genes that may serve as candidate
              biomarkers of aging. At the translational level, we uncovered

              Prunetin, a representative isoflavone, was recently found to
              affect cell signaling in cultured cells; however, in vivo effects
              remain elusive. In this study, the model organism Drosophila
              melanogaster was used to investigate the effects of prunetin in
              vivo with respect to lifespan, locomotion, body composition,
              metabolism, and gut health. Adult flies were chronically
              administered a prunetin-supplemented diet. Prunetin improved
              median survival by 3 d, and climbing activity increased by 54\%
              in males. In comparison with the females, male flies exhibited
              lower climbing activity, which was reversed by prunetin intake.
              Furthermore, prunetin-fed males exhibited increased expression of
              the longevity gene Sirtuin 1 (Sir2) (22\%), as well as elevated
              AMPK activation (51\%) and triglyceride levels (29\%), whereas
              glucose levels decreased (36\%). As females are long-lived
              compared with their male counterparts and exhibit higher
              triglyceride levels, prunetin apparently ``feminizes'' male flies
              via its estrogenicity. We conclude that the lifespan-prolonging
              effects of prunetin in the male fruit fly depend on changes in
              AMPK-regulated energy homeostasis via male ``feminization.''

              methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a tumor suppressor
              gene that is frequently inactivated in a wide variety of human
              cancers. In this study, we have examined if heterozygosity for a
              null mutation in Mtap (Mtap(lacZ)) could accelerate tumorigenesis
              development in two different mouse cancer models, E$\mu$-myc
              transgenic and Pten(+/-) . METHODS: Mtap E$\mu$-myc and Mtap Pten
              mice were generated and tumor-free survival was monitored over
              time. Tumors were also examined for a variety of histological and
              protein markers. In addition, microarray analysis was performed
              on the livers of Mtap(lacZ/+) and Mtap (+/+) mice. RESULTS:
              Survival in both models was significantly decreased in
              Mtap(lacZ/+) compared to Mtap(+/+) mice. In Eµ-myc mice, Mtap
              mutations accelerated the formation of lymphomas from cells in
              the early pre-B stage, and these tumors tended to be of higher
              grade and have higher expression levels of ornithine
              decarboxylase compared to those observed in control Eµ-myc
              Mtap(+/+) mice. Surprisingly, examination of Mtap status in
              lymphomas in Eµ-myc Mtap(lacZ/+) and Eµ-myc Mtap(+/+) animals did
              not reveal significant differences in the frequency of loss of
              Mtap protein expression, despite having shorter latency times,
              suggesting that haploinsufficiency of Mtap may be playing a
              direct role in accelerating tumorigenesis. Consistent with this
              idea, microarray analysis on liver tissue from age and sex
              matched Mtap(+/+) and Mtap(lacZ/+) animals found 363 transcripts
              whose expression changed at least 1.5-fold (P<0.01). Functional
              categorization of these genes reveals enrichments in several
              pathways involved in growth control and cancer. CONCLUSION: Our
              findings show that germline inactivation of a single Mtap allele

              limited by the availability of both comprehensive clinical data
              on population-scale cohorts and the lack of suitable statistical
              methodology that can handle the scale of and differential power
              inherent in multi-phenotype data. Here, we develop a
              disease-agnostic approach to cluster the genetic risk profiles
              for 3,025 genome-wide independent loci across 19,155 disease
              classification codes from 320,644 participants in the UK Biobank,
              representing a large and heterogeneous population. We identify
              339 distinct disease association profiles and use multiple
              approaches to link clusters to the underlying biological
              pathways. We show how clusters can decompose the variance and
              covariance in risk for disease, thereby identifying underlying
              biological processes and their impact. We demonstrate the use of
              clusters in defining disease relationships and their potential in
              informing therapeutic strategies.",

              aging, the collection of which we call the `gerontome'. Although
              some individual aging-related genes have been the subject of
              intense scrutiny, their analysis as a whole has been limited. In
              particular, the genetic interaction of aging and age-related
              pathologies remain a subject of debate. In this work, we perform
              a systematic analysis of the gerontome across species, including
              human aging-related genes. First, by classifying aging-related
              genes as pro- or anti-longevity, we define distinct pathways and
              genes that modulate aging in different ways. Our subsequent
              comparison of aging-related genes with age-related disease genes
              reveals species-specific effects with strong overlaps between
              aging and age-related diseases in mice, yet surprisingly few
              overlaps in lower model organisms. We discover that genetic links
              between aging and age-related diseases are due to a small
              fraction of aging-related genes which also tend to have a high
              network connectivity. Other insights from our systematic analysis

              aging may influence age-related diseases in humans as well. To
              determine whether there is genetic evidence supporting the notion
              of common pathways underlying age-related diseases, we analyzed
              the genes and pathways found to be associated with five major
              categories of age-related disease using a total of 410 genomewide
              association studies (GWAS). While only a small number of genes
              are shared among all five disease categories, those found in at
              least three of the five major age-related disease categories are
              highly enriched for apoliprotein metabolism genes. We found that
              a more substantial number of gene ontology (GO) terms are shared

              characterized by dysregulated expression of metabolic enzymes.
              Patients with metastatic RCC have an unusually poor prognosis and
              near-universal resistance to all current therapies. To improve
              RCC treatment and the survival rate of patients with RCC, there
              is an urgent need to reveal the mechanisms by which metabolic
              reprogramming regulates aberrant signaling and oncogenic
              progression. Through an integrated analysis of RCC metabolic
              pathways, we showed that methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)
              and its substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA) are dysregulated in
              aggressive RCC. A decrease in MTAP expression was observed in RCC
              tissues and correlated with higher tumor grade and shorter
              overall survival. Genetic manipulation of MTAP demonstrated that
              MTAP expression inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
              invasion and migration of RCC cells. Interestingly, we found a
              decrease in the protein methylation level with a concomitant
              increase in tyrosine phosphorylation after MTAP knockout. A
              phospho-kinase array screen identified the type 1 insulin-like
              growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) as the candidate with the
              highest upregulation in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to
              MTAP loss. We further demonstrated that IGF1R phosphorylation
              acts upstream of Src and STAT3 signaling in MTAP-knockout RCC
              cells. IGF1R suppression by a selective inhibitor of IGF1R,
              linsitinib, impaired the cell migration and invasion capability
              of MTAP-deleted cells. Surprisingly, an increase in
              linsitinib-mediated cytotoxicity occurred in RCC cells with MTAP

  abstract = "Age is the main risk factor for the prevalent diseases of
              developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and
              neurodegeneration. The ageing process is deleterious for fitness,
              but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining
              force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to
              extrinsic hazards to survival: ageing can then occur as a
              side-effect of accumulation of mutations that lower fitness at
              later ages, or of natural selection in favour of mutations that
              increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher
              subsequent rate of ageing. Once thought of as an inexorable,
              complex and lineage-specific process of accumulation of damage,
              ageing has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show
              strong evolutionary conservation. Lowered activity of the
              nutrient-sensing insulin/insulin-like growth factor/Target of
              Rapamycin signalling network can extend healthy lifespan in
              yeast, multicellular invertebrates, mice and, possibly, humans.
              Mitochondrial activity can also promote ageing, while genome
              maintenance and autophagy can protect against it. We discuss the
              relationship between evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of
              ageing and disease, and the associated scientific challenges and

              perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical
              development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal
              dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal
              cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal
              development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression
              changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in
              early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this
              pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in
              neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust
              associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene
              expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association
              between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects
              and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles.
              Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular

              Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for
              example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8

@ARTICLE{Williams1957,
  title     = "Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence",
  author    = "Williams, George C",
  abstract  = "[A new individual entering a population may be said to have a
               reproductive probability distribution. The reproductive
               probability is zero from zygote to reproductive maturity. Later,
               perhaps shortly after maturity, it reaches a peak value. Then it
               declines due to the cumulative probability of death. There is a
               cumulative probability of death with or without senescence. The
               selective value of a gene depends on how it affects the total
               reproductive probability. Selection of a gene that confers an
               advantage at one age and a disadvantage at another will depend
               not only on the magnitudes of the effects themselves, but also
               on the times of the effects. An advantage during the period of
               maximum reproductive probability would increase the total
               reproductive probability more than a proportionately similar
               disadvantage later on would decrease it. So natural selection
               will frequently maximize vigor in youth at the expense of vigor
               later on and thereby produce a declining vigor (senescence)
               during adult life. Selection, of course, will act to minimize
               the rate of this decline whenever possible. The rate of
               senescence shown by any species will reflect the balance between
               this direct, adverse selection of senescence as an unfavorable
               character, and the indirect, favorable selection through the
               age-related bias in the selection of pleiotropic genes.
               Variations in the amount of fecundity increase after maturity,
               in the adult mortality rate, and in other life-history features
               would affect the shape of the reproductive probability
               distribution and thereby influence the evolution of senescence.
               Any factor that decreases the rate of decline in reproductive
               probability intensifies selection against senescence. Any factor
               that increases the rate of this decline causes a relaxed
               selection against senescence and a greater advantage in
               increasing youthful vigor at the price of vigor later on. These
               considerations explain much of what is known of phylogenetic
               variation in rates of senescence. Other deductions from the
               theory are also supported by limited available evidence. These
               include the expectation that rapid morphogenesis should be
               associated with rapid senescence, that senescence should always
               be a generalized deterioration of many organs and systems, and
               that post-reproductive periods be short and infrequent in any
               wild population.]",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although life expectancy in the European Union (EU)
              is increasing, whether most of these extra years are spent in
              good health is unclear. This information would be crucial to both
              contain health-care costs and increase labour-force participation
              for older people. We investigated inequalities in life
              expectancies and healthy life years (HLYs) at 50 years of age for
              the 25 countries in the EU in 2005 and the potential for
              increasing the proportion of older people in the labour force.
              METHODS: We calculated life expectancies and HLYs at 50 years of
              age by sex and country by the Sullivan method, which was applied
              to Eurostat life tables and age-specific prevalence of activity
              limitation from the 2005 statistics of living and income
              conditions survey. We investigated differences between countries
              through meta-regression techniques, with structural and
              sustainable indicators for every country. FINDINGS: In 2005, an
              average 50-year-old man in the 25 EU countries could expect to
              live until 67.3 years free of activity limitation, and a woman to
              68.1 years. HLYs at 50 years for both men and women varied more
              between countries than did life expectancy (HLY range for men:
              from 9.1 years in Estonia to 23.6 years in Denmark; for women:
              from 10.4 years in Estonia to 24.1 years in Denmark). Gross
              domestic product and expenditure on elderly care were both
              positively associated with HLYs at 50 years in men and women
              (p<0.039 for both indicators and sexes); however, in men alone,
              long-term unemployment was negatively associated (p=0.023) and
              life-long learning positively associated (p=0.021) with HLYs at
              50 years of age. INTERPRETATION: Substantial inequalities in HLYs
              at 50 years exist within EU countries. Our findings suggest that,
              without major improvements in population health, the target of
              increasing participation of older people into the labour force
              will be difficult to meet in all 25 EU countries. FUNDING: EU

              explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical
              understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our
              knowledge of positive selection. Here, we describe the
              Non-central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to
              detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how
              close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides
              the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single
              locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only
              polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with
              respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed
              differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect
              LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced
              allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide
              data from African and European human populations, in both cases
              using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not
              prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: ∼0.6\%
              of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8\% of analyzed positions.
              Significant windows (P < 0.0001) contain 1.6\% of SNPs in the
              genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change
              protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory
              sites. These windows overlap ∼8\% of the protein-coding genes,
              and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by
              chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog
              includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90\%) are
              novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the
              strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in

              Histologic subtypes included 25 adenocarcinomas (50\%), 21

              (8\%). Homozygous deletions of MTAP exon 8 could be detected in
              19 of 50 NSCLC samples (38\%). Adenocarcinoma (11 of 25, 44\%)
              showed a higher deletion frequency than squamous cell carcinoma
              (six of 21, 29\%). In contrast, homozygous p16INK4A deletions
              were detected in only nine of 50 (18\%) samples using specific
              primers for p16INK4A exon 1alpha. No difference between the
              histological subtypes and p16INK4A deletion frequency was

              deletions but intact p16INK4A exon 1alpha with primers specific
              for p16INK4A exon 3, the exon nearest to MTAP exon 8.
              Interestingly, none of the ten samples had deletion of the

  abstract = "The past century was a period of increasing life expectancy
              throughout the age range. This resulted in more people living to
              old age and to spending more years at the older ages. It is
              likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages will
              continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach
              levels above 95 unless there is a fundamental change in our
              ability to delay the aging process. We have yet to experience
              much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of most health
              problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there
              have been some reductions in the prevalence of physical
              disability and dementia. At the same time, the prevalence of
              disease has increased markedly, in large part due to treatment
              which extends life for those with disease. Compressing morbidity
              or increasing the relative healthspan will require ``delaying
              aging'' or delaying the physiological change that results in
              disease and disability. While moving to life expectancies above
              age 95 and compressing morbidity substantially may require
              significant scientific breakthroughs; significant improvement in
              health and increases in life expectancy in the United States
              could be achieved with behavioral, life style, and policy changes
              that reduce socioeconomic disparities and allow us to reach the

              for CDKN2A and ARF in tumorigenesis is well established, but
              whether MTAP loss directly affects tumorigenesis is unclear. MTAP
              encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, a key

              Lymphoma-infiltrated tissues tend to have reduced levels of Mtap
              mRNA and MTAP protein in addition to unaltered levels of

              exploring the underlying mechanisms of genetic diseases. Recent
              studies suggest that the relationship between genetic diseases
              and the aging process is important in understanding the molecular
              mechanisms of complex diseases. Although some intricate
              associations have been investigated for a long time, the studies
              are still in their early stages. In this paper, we construct a
              human disease-aging network to study the relationship among aging
              genes and genetic disease genes. Specifically, we integrate human
              protein-protein interactions (PPIs), disease-gene associations,
              aging-gene associations, and physiological system-based genetic
              disease classification information in a single graph-theoretic
              framework and find that (1) human disease genes are much closer
              to aging genes than expected by chance; and (2) diseases can be
              categorized into two types according to their relationships with
              aging. Type I diseases have their genes significantly close to
              aging genes, while type II diseases do not. Furthermore, we
              examine the topological characters of the disease-aging network
              from a systems perspective. Theoretical results reveal that the
              genes of type I diseases are in a central position of a PPI
              network while type II are not; (3) more importantly, we define an
              asymmetric closeness based on the PPI network to describe
              relationships between diseases, and find that aging genes make a
              significant contribution to associations among diseases,
              especially among type I diseases. In conclusion, the
              network-based study provides not only evidence for the intricate
              relationship between the aging process and genetic diseases, but
              also biological implications for prying into the nature of human

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Robust replication is a sine qua non for the rigorous
              documentation of proposed associations in the genome-wide
              association (GWA) setting. Currently, associations of common
              variants reaching P $\leq$ 5 $\times$ 10(-8) are considered
              replicated. However, there is some ambiguity about the most
              suitable threshold for claiming genome-wide significance.
              METHODS: We defined as 'borderline' associations those with P > 5
              $\times$ 10(-8) and P $\leq$ 1 $\times$ 10(-7). The eligible
              associations were retrieved using the 'Catalog of Published
              Genome-Wide Association Studies'. For each association we
              assessed whether it reached P $\leq$ 5 $\times$ 10(-8) with
              inclusion of additional data from subsequent GWA studies.
              RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible genotype-phenotype associations
              were evaluated with data and clarifications contributed from
              diverse investigators. Replication data from subsequent GWA
              studies could be obtained for 26 of them. Of those, 19
              associations (73\%) reached P $\leq$ 5 $\times$ 10(-8) for the
              same or a related trait implicating either the exact same allele
              or one in very high linkage disequilibrium and 17 reached P
              10(-6) [corresponding false-discovery rate 19\% (95\% CI
              7-39\%)]. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion, but not all, of
              the associations with borderline genome-wide significance
              represent replicable, possibly genuine associations. Our
              empirical evaluation suggests a possible relaxation in the
              current GWS threshold.",

              integrity, leading to impaired function and increased

              cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging
              research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent
              years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is

              biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review

              denominators of aging in different organisms, with special
              emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic
              instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of
              proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial
              dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and
              altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to
              dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks

              successful theory of why organisms age, firmly rooted in

              aging had a secure experimental basis. Since the force of
              selection declines with age, aging evolves due to mutation

              review major insights and challenges that have emerged over the
              last 35 years: selection does not always necessarily decline with
              age; higher extrinsic (i.e., environmentally caused) mortality
