I am indebted to many people who made this thesis possible. First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Janet Thornton. I am grateful for her time, guidance, discussions and support, which were indispensable for this thesis and the early steps of my journey to become a scientist. I was also very lucky to be supervised by Janet, as at a very early stage of my career, I had the chance to observe first hand that it is possible to become a great scientist without compromising values and virtues.

I want to thank all members of the spice family for creating such a friendly and supportive environment. My special thanks to Daniel Fabian and Matias Fuentealba, who were not only great colleagues but also comrades in my journey. During my PhD, I had the chance to work closely with visitor students in our group. Many thanks, Veronika Kedlian, Lori Kregar, Victor Laigle, and Gozde Turan! I also must acknowledge the contributions Ulas Isildak, another student we worked together from distance. It was a privilege to work with all of you! Our discussions were incredibly helpful and your contributions were fundamental for my PhD.

I also want to thank all members of the societies I have been a part of, ISCBSC RSG-Turkey, epiSTEM Turkiye, and EkoEvo. They gave me invaluable chances to contribute to the scientific environment in my home country, even though I was far away. I also want to thank ISCB Student Council for sparing a place for me in their organization and sharing my enthusiasm to communicate research to everyone for free.

A huge thanks to all PhD students at the EBI. Also, I want to thank my Turkish-speaking friends in Cambridge, especially to Poorya Parvizi and Ozge Gizlenci. My special thanks to Betul Taskoparan, Hamit Izgi, Buse Isbilir, Ekin Saglican, and Gulsah Kilinc, who keep proving that geographic distance has no effect on true friendship. I have remained sane(-ish) thanks to all of your support and friendship. I also want to thank Mehmet Somel, who motivated me years ago to pursue research on ageing and remains as a trusted mentor.

I want to express my gratitude to the essential components which made my journey to here possible in the first place. I must acknowledge the EMBL-EBI for funding the studies of overseas students, a rare example of true inclusiveness. The only reason I could imagine to come here to pursue my PhD at the EBI and University of Cambridge is the public school system I studied in, which allowed free and high-quality education for everybody, starting from elementary school to post-graduate degrees. I hope that creating equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of the economic background, could be included in the discussion of diversity in academia.

Last but certainly not least, I want to thank my mother and grandmother for their continuous love and encouragement. This thesis would not exist without their support at every stage of my life.
