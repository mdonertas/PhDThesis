  abstract = "From the moment of conception, we begin to age. A decay of
              cellular structures, gene regulation, and DNA sequence ages cells
              and organisms. DNA methylation patterns change with increasing
              age and contribute to age related disease. Here we identify 88
              sites in or near 80 genes for which the degree of cytosine
              methylation is significantly correlated with age in saliva of 34
              male identical twin pairs between 21 and 55 years of age.
              Furthermore, we validated sites in the promoters of three genes
              and replicated our results in a general population sample of 31
              males and 29 females between 18 and 70 years of age. The
              methylation of three sites--in the promoters of the EDARADD,
              TOM1L1, and NPTX2 genes--is linear with age over a range of five
              decades. Using just two cytosines from these loci, we built a
              regression model that explained 73\% of the variance in age, and
              is able to predict the age of an individual with an average
              accuracy of 5.2 years. In forensic science, such a model could
              estimate the age of a person, based on a biological sample alone.
              Furthermore, a measurement of relevant sites in the genome could
              be a tool in routine medical screening to predict the risk of
              age-related diseases and to tailor interventions based on the
              epigenetic bio-age instead of the chronological age.",

              chromosomes) are part of the 3D spatial organization of the
              nuclear genome. Long-range 3D chromatin interactions also
              establish specific patterns of regulated gene expression. An
              emerging area of interest is the role of telomere 3D looping with
              interstitial telomeric sequences (ITS) through interactions with
              telomere shelterin proteins. Telomeres form interstitial telomere
              loops (ITL) that interact with ITS and modify gene expression at
              distal genomic regions. Human laminopathies and telomeropathies
              often correlate with short telomeres. Since telomeres
              progressively shorten with increased turnover and chronological
              age in dividing somatic cells, ITLs may also change and have
              functional roles in normal and pathophysiological processes.
              Overall, telomeres help stabilize the nuclear genome with high

              throughout the age range. This resulted in more people living to
              old age and to spending more years at the older ages. It is
              likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages will
              continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach
              levels above 95 unless there is a fundamental change in our
              ability to delay the aging process. We have yet to experience
              much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of most health
              problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there
              have been some reductions in the prevalence of physical
              disability and dementia. At the same time, the prevalence of
              disease has increased markedly, in large part due to treatment
              which extends life for those with disease. Compressing morbidity

              disease and disability. While moving to life expectancies above
              age 95 and compressing morbidity substantially may require
              significant scientific breakthroughs; significant improvement in
              health and increases in life expectancy in the United States

              tissue samples, representing 36 distinct tissues. This catalog,
              containing over 280,000 mutations, reveals a wide diversity of

              trastuzumab-resistant erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
              because it targets the critical signaling pathways that are
              altered with resistance. BT474, SKBR3 and derived
              trastuzumab-resistant sublines BT474-HR20 (HR20) and SKBR3-pool2
              (pool2) were used to test this hypothesis. Metformin treatment
              resulted in significantly more inhibition of proliferation and
              clonogenicity in resistant sublines. It decreased
              erbB2/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) complexes
              (present only in the resistant sublines) without altering erbB2
              expression, and reduced the expression and activity of erbB3 and
              IGF-1R in the trastuzumab-resistant but not parental cells.
              Trastuzumab-resistant sublines were resistant to rapamycin
              induced changes in mTOR activity and cell growth. In contrast,
              both BT474 and HR20 cells were highly sensitive to inhibitors of
              Src (Dasatinib) and PI-3K (LY294002). The pool2 cells showed
              higher sensitivity than SKBR3 cells to LY294002, but not
              Dasatinib. On the basis of these data, metformin appears to be
              significantly more effective against trastuzumab-resistant as
              compared to sensitive breast cancer cells. Metformin disrupts
              erbB2/IGF-1R complexes, erbB3 and IGF-1R expression and activity,
              as well as Src kinase and/or PI-3K/Akt signaling. This action
              appears to be independent of mTOR signaling. Our findings provide

               understand senescence in birds and mammals in the wild.
               Increasing age-specific mortality in adulthood is widely used as
               the gold standard of senescence, both in natural and in
               laboratory populations. Both reproductive and survival
               senescence can be difficult to detect in the presence of
               infectious disease. The relationship between senescence and
               disease is complex. Decreased reproductive performance near the
               very end of life might as easily reflect infectious status as
               senescence per se. A potentially useful way of envisioning
               demographic senescence is to assess the maintenance of adaptive
               tradeoffs between reproduction and somatic survival as they
               occur in young adults. Senescence could potentially be seen as
               well in reduced ability to provide nourishment to offspring.
               Mammary glands themselves may senesce because of a decreasing
               replicative capacity of mammary epithelial cells with age. The
               ability to defend a territory declines with age in a number of
               species. In small passerine birds, the great tit, male territory
               size increases until 4 years of age and then decreases from 5
               years throughout the rest of life.",

              that chronic diseases are not only the result of ageing and
              inflammaging; these diseases also accelerate the ageing process
              and can be considered a manifestation of accelerated ageing.

              studies have linked the locus to a number of aging-associated

              the global impact of the Ink4/Arf locus on organismal aging and
              longevity was lacking. In this work, we have examined the
              fertility, cancer susceptibility, aging and longevity of mice
              genetically modified to carry one (Ink4/Arf-tg) or two
              (Ink4/Arf-tg/tg) intact additional copies of the locus. First,
              increased gene dosage of Ink4/Arf impairs the production of male
              germ cells, and in the case of Ink4/Arf-tg/tg mice results in a

              Regarding cancer, there is a lower incidence of aging-associated
              cancer proportional to the Ink4/Arf gene dosage. Interestingly,
              increased Ink4/Arf gene dosage resulted in lower scores in aging
              markers and in extended median longevity. The increased survival

              cell) activity due to a loss of Notch signalling results in
              impaired regeneration of aged muscle. The decline in hepatic

              conducted, yet given the noisy nature of gene expression changes
              with age, elucidating the transcriptional features of aging and
              how these relate to physiological, biochemical and pathological
              changes remains a critical problem. RESULTS: We performed a
              meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles using 27
              datasets from mice, rats and humans. Our results reveal several
              common signatures of aging, including 56 genes consistently
              overexpressed with age, the most significant of which was APOD,
              and 17 genes underexpressed with age. We characterized the
              biological processes associated with these signatures and found
              that age-related gene expression changes most notably involve an
              overexpression of inflammation and immune response genes and of
              genes associated with the lysosome. An underexpression of
              collagen genes and of genes associated with energy metabolism,
              particularly mitochondrial genes, as well as alterations in the
              expression of genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle and cellular
              senescence biomarkers, were also observed. By employing a new
              method that emphasizes sensitivity, our work further reveals
              previously unknown transcriptional changes with age in many
              genes, processes and functions. We suggest these molecular
              signatures reflect a combination of degenerative processes but
              also transcriptional responses to the process of aging. Overall,
              our results help to understand how transcriptional changes relate
              to the process of aging and could serve as targets for future

  abstract = "Background: Aging is a pleiotropic process affecting many aspects
              of organismal and cellular physiology. Mammalian organisms are
              composed of a constellation of distinct cell type and state
              identities residing within different tissue environments. Due to
              technological limitations, the study of aging has traditionally
              focused on changes within individual cell types, or the aggregate
              changes across cell types within a tissue. The influence of cell
              identity and tissue environment on the trajectory of aging
              therefore remains unclear. Results: Here, we perform single cell
              RNA-seq on >50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young
              and aged mice. These molecular profiles allow for comparison of
              aging phenotypes across cell types and tissue environments. We
              find transcriptional features of aging common across many cell
              types, as well as features of aging unique to each type.
              Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we
              compute a trajectory and magnitude of aging for each cell type.
              We find that cell type exerts a larger influence on these
              measures than tissue environment. Conclusion: In this study, we
              use single cell RNA-seq to dissect the influence of cell identity
              and tissue environment on the aging process. Single cell analysis
              reveals that cell identities age in unique ways, with some common
              features of aging shared across identities. We find that both
              cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the
              trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence
              predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with
              unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell

  author    = "Williams, George C",
  abstract  = "[A new individual entering a population may be said to have a
               reproductive probability distribution. The reproductive
               probability is zero from zygote to reproductive maturity. Later,
               perhaps shortly after maturity, it reaches a peak value. Then it
               declines due to the cumulative probability of death. There is a
               cumulative probability of death with or without senescence. The
               selective value of a gene depends on how it affects the total
               reproductive probability. Selection of a gene that confers an
               advantage at one age and a disadvantage at another will depend
               not only on the magnitudes of the effects themselves, but also
               on the times of the effects. An advantage during the period of
               maximum reproductive probability would increase the total
               reproductive probability more than a proportionately similar
               disadvantage later on would decrease it. So natural selection
               will frequently maximize vigor in youth at the expense of vigor
               later on and thereby produce a declining vigor (senescence)
               during adult life. Selection, of course, will act to minimize
               the rate of this decline whenever possible. The rate of
               senescence shown by any species will reflect the balance between
               this direct, adverse selection of senescence as an unfavorable
               character, and the indirect, favorable selection through the
               age-related bias in the selection of pleiotropic genes.
               Variations in the amount of fecundity increase after maturity,
               in the adult mortality rate, and in other life-history features
               would affect the shape of the reproductive probability
               distribution and thereby influence the evolution of senescence.
               Any factor that decreases the rate of decline in reproductive
               probability intensifies selection against senescence. Any factor
               that increases the rate of this decline causes a relaxed
               selection against senescence and a greater advantage in
               increasing youthful vigor at the price of vigor later on. These
               considerations explain much of what is known of phylogenetic
               variation in rates of senescence. Other deductions from the
               theory are also supported by limited available evidence. These
               include the expectation that rapid morphogenesis should be
               associated with rapid senescence, that senescence should always
               be a generalized deterioration of many organs and systems, and
               that post-reproductive periods be short and infrequent in any
               wild population.]",

              remedies that may stem declining organ function and maintain
              fitness. Unanswered is whether elimination of intrinsic
              instigators driving age-associated degeneration can reverse, as
              opposed to simply arrest, various afflictions of the aged. Such
              instigators include progressively damaged genomes.
              Telomerase-deficient mice have served as a model system to study
              the adverse cellular and organismal consequences of wide-spread
              endogenous DNA damage signalling activation in vivo. Telomere
              loss and uncapping provokes progressive tissue atrophy, stem cell
              depletion, organ system failure and impaired tissue injury
              responses. Here, we sought to determine whether entrenched
              multi-system degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere
              dysfunction can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of
              endogenous telomerase activity. To this end, we engineered a
              knock-in allele encoding a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible
              telomerase reverse transcriptase-oestrogen receptor (TERT-ER)
              under transcriptional control of the endogenous TERT promoter.
              Homozygous TERT-ER mice have short dysfunctional telomeres and
              sustain increased DNA damage signalling and classical
              degenerative phenotypes upon successive generational matings and
              advancing age. Telomerase reactivation in such late generation
              TERT-ER mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling and
              associated cellular checkpoint responses, allows resumption of
              proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminates degenerative
              phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleens and
              intestines. Notably, somatic telomerase reactivation reversed
              neurodegeneration with restoration of proliferating Sox2(+)
              neural progenitors, Dcx(+) newborn neurons, and Olig2(+)
              oligodendrocyte populations. Consistent with the integral role of
              subventricular zone neural progenitors in generation and
              maintenance of olfactory bulb interneurons, this wave of
              telomerase-dependent neurogenesis resulted in alleviation of
              hyposmia and recovery of innate olfactory avoidance responses.
              Accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of
              age-associated organ decline and disease risk and the marked
              reversal of systemic degenerative phenotypes in adult mice

              degrees age-1(hx546) averages a 65\% increase in mean life span
              (25.3 days vs. 15.0 days) and a 110\% increase in maximum life
              span (46.2 days vs. 22.0 days for wild-type hermaphrodites).
              Mutant males also show extended life spans. age-1(hx546) is
              associated with a 75\% decrease in hermaphrodite self-fertility
              as compared to the age-1+ allele at 20 degrees. Using two novel
              strategies for following the segregation of age-1, we present
              evidence that longer life results from a mutation in a single
              gene that increases the probability of survival at all
              chronological ages. The long-life and reduced-fertility
              phenotypes cosegregate and are tightly linked to fer-15, a locus
              on linkage group II. age-1(hx546) does not affect the timing of
              larval molts, the length of embryogenesis, food uptake, movement,
              or behavior in any way tested. Although age-1(hx546) lowers

              expectancy due to an increase in the length of postreproductive
              life. In so far as we are aware, this mutant in age-1 is the only
              instance of a well-characterized genetic locus in which the
              mutant form results in lengthened fife. It is likely that the
              action of age-1 in lengthening life results not from eliminating
              a programmed aging function but rather from reduced hermaphrodite
              self-fertility or from some other unknown metabolic or

              the genes and pathways found to be associated with five major

              riddle, because it is difficult to explain the evolution of a
              trait that has apparently no benefit to the individual. Over 60
              years ago, Medawar realized that the force of natural selection
              declines with chronological age because of unavoidable
              environmental risks. This forms the basis of the mainstream view
              that aging arises as a consequence of a declining selection
              pressure to maintain the physiological functioning of living
              beings forever. Over recent years, however, a number of articles
              have appeared that nevertheless propose the existence of specific
              aging genes; that is, that the aging process is genetically
              programmed. If this view were correct, it would have serious
              implications for experiments to understand and postpone aging.
              Therefore, we studied in detail various specific proposals why
              aging should be programmed. We find that not a single one

              Medawar (as further developed by Hamilton and Charlesworth) are
              still the best explanation for the evolution of the aging

              To gain more information on the effects of ageing on lncRNAs, we

  abstract = "The objectives of this review on 'leaky gut' for clinicians are
              to discuss the components of the intestinal barrier, the diverse
              measurements of intestinal permeability, their perturbation in
              non-inflammatory 'stressed states' and the impact of treatment
              with dietary factors. Information on 'healthy' or 'leaky' gut in
              the public domain requires confirmation before endorsing dietary
              exclusions, replacement with non-irritating foods (such as
              fermented foods) or use of supplements to repair the damage. The
              intestinal barrier includes surface mucus, epithelial layer and
              immune defences. Epithelial permeability results from increased
              paracellular transport, apoptosis or transcellular permeability.
              Barrier function can be tested in vivo using orally administered
              probe molecules or in vitro using mucosal biopsies from humans,
              exposing the colonic mucosa from rats or mice or cell layers to
              extracts of colonic mucosa or stool from human patients.
              Assessment of intestinal barrier requires measurements beyond the
              epithelial layer. 'Stress' disorders such as endurance exercise,
              non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration, pregnancy
              and surfactants (such as bile acids and dietary factors such as
              emulsifiers) increase permeability. Dietary factors can reverse
              intestinal leakiness and mucosal damage in the 'stress'
              disorders. Whereas inflammatory or ulcerating intestinal diseases
              result in leaky gut, no such disease can be cured by simply
              normalising intestinal barrier function. It is still unproven
              that restoring barrier function can ameliorate clinical
              manifestations in GI or systemic diseases. Clinicians should be
              aware of the potential of barrier dysfunction in GI diseases and
              of the barrier as a target for future therapy.",

              is increasing, whether most of these extra years are spent in
              good health is unclear. This information would be crucial to both
              contain health-care costs and increase labour-force participation
              for older people. We investigated inequalities in life
              expectancies and healthy life years (HLYs) at 50 years of age for
              the 25 countries in the EU in 2005 and the potential for
              increasing the proportion of older people in the labour force.
              METHODS: We calculated life expectancies and HLYs at 50 years of
              age by sex and country by the Sullivan method, which was applied
              to Eurostat life tables and age-specific prevalence of activity
              limitation from the 2005 statistics of living and income
              conditions survey. We investigated differences between countries
              through meta-regression techniques, with structural and
              sustainable indicators for every country. FINDINGS: In 2005, an
              average 50-year-old man in the 25 EU countries could expect to
              live until 67.3 years free of activity limitation, and a woman to
              68.1 years. HLYs at 50 years for both men and women varied more
              between countries than did life expectancy (HLY range for men:
              from 9.1 years in Estonia to 23.6 years in Denmark; for women:
              from 10.4 years in Estonia to 24.1 years in Denmark). Gross
              domestic product and expenditure on elderly care were both
              positively associated with HLYs at 50 years in men and women
              (p<0.039 for both indicators and sexes); however, in men alone,
              long-term unemployment was negatively associated (p=0.023) and
              life-long learning positively associated (p=0.021) with HLYs at
              50 years of age. INTERPRETATION: Substantial inequalities in HLYs
              at 50 years exist within EU countries. Our findings suggest that,
              without major improvements in population health, the target of
              increasing participation of older people into the labour force
              will be difficult to meet in all 25 EU countries. FUNDING: EU

              12-fold more likely to be methylated in cancer than non-PCGTs.
              Age is the most important demographic risk factor for cancer, and
              we hypothesized that its carcinogenic potential may be referred
              by irreversibly stabilizing stem cell features. To test this, we
              analyzed the methylation status of over 27,000 CpGs mapping to
              promoters of approximately 14,000 genes in whole blood samples
              from 261 postmenopausal women. We demonstrate that stem cell
              PCGTs are far more likely to become methylated with age than
              non-targets (odds ratio = 5.3 [3.8-7.4], P < 10(-10)),

              population of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (P <

              present in preneoplastic conditions and may drive gene expression
              changes associated with carcinogenesis. These findings shed
              substantial novel insights into the epigenetic effects of aging

              human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age
              prediction is a biologically meaningful measure. RESULTS: I
              developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to
              estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types.
              The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using
              8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets,
              encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA
              methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close
              to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second,
              it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a
              highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is
              applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer
              samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20
              cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an
              average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is
              associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53
              mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly
              accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I
              characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock
              in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance. CONCLUSIONS: I
              propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect
              of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock

              71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in

              independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6

              enriched at polycomb repressed regions and, accordingly,
              methylation at those positions is associated with the expression
              of genes encoding components of polycomb repressive complex 2
              (PRC2) in trans. Further analysis revealed trans-associations for
              1816 aVMPs with an additional 854 genes. These trans-associated
              aVMPs are characterized by either an age-related gain of
              methylation at CpG islands marked by PRC2 or a loss of
              methylation at enhancers. This distinct pattern extends to other
              tissues and multiple cancer types. Finally, genes associated with
              aVMPs in trans whose expression is variably upregulated with age
              (733 genes) play a key role in DNA repair and apoptosis, whereas
              downregulated aVMP-associated genes (121 genes) are mapped to
              defined pathways in cellular metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results

              mechanisms that are thought to drive human ageing.",

              perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical

              development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression
              changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in
              early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this
              pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in
              neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust
              associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene
              expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association

              Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular

              early developmental factors affect health outcomes in old age.
              METHODS: Metabolomic profiling on fasting blood was carried out
              in 6055 individuals from the UK. Stepwise regression was
              performed to identify a panel of independent metabolites which
              could be used as a surrogate for age. We also investigated the
              association with birthweight overall and within identical
              discordant twins and with genome-wide methylation levels.
              RESULTS: We identified a panel of 22 metabolites which combined
              are strongly correlated with age (R(2) = 59\%) and with
              age-related clinical traits independently of age. One particular
              metabolite, C-glycosyl tryptophan (C-glyTrp), correlated strongly
              with age (beta = 0.03, SE = 0.001, P = 7.0 $\times$ 10(-157)) and
              lung function (FEV1 beta = -0.04, SE = 0.008, P = 1.8 $\times$
              10(-8) adjusted for age and confounders) and was replicated in an
              independent population (n = 887). C-glyTrp was also associated
              with bone mineral density (beta = -0.01, SE = 0.002, P = 1.9
              $\times$ 10(-6)) and birthweight (beta = -0.06, SE = 0.01, P =
              2.5 $\times$ 10(-9)). The difference in C-glyTrp levels explained
              9.4\% of the variance in the difference in birthweight between
              monozygotic twins. An epigenome-wide association study in 172
              individuals identified three CpG-sites, associated with levels of
              C-glyTrp (P < 2 $\times$ 10(-6)). We replicated one CpG site in
              the promoter of the WDR85 gene in an independent sample of 350
              individuals (beta = -0.20, SE = 0.04, P = 2.9 $\times$ 10(-8)).
              WDR85 is a regulator of translation elongation factor 2,

              diseases, prominently including neurodegenerative disorders such

              age-related diseases is the dysfunction in protein homeostasis
              (proteostasis), leading to the accumulation of protein
              aggregates. In healthy cells, a complex proteostasis network,
              comprising molecular chaperones and proteolytic machineries and
              their regulators, operates to ensure the maintenance of
              proteostasis. These factors coordinate protein synthesis with
              polypeptide folding, the conservation of protein conformation and
              protein degradation. However, sustaining proteome balance is a
              challenging task in the face of various external and endogenous

              Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is
              largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish
              (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we
              show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating

              individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span
              extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention
              prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with
              host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community,
              characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera
              Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter.
              Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community
              of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial

              aging had a secure experimental basis. Since the force of

              age; higher extrinsic (i.e., environmentally caused) mortality

              Age-associated dysfunction of brain leads to severe health
              problems in current aging society. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have
              emerged as important regulators in most physiological processes
              including fine-tuning of the short-term, cellular regulatory
              functions as well as modulation of long-term organismal lifespan.
              In this review, we discuss critical roles of miRNAs in the
              progression of normal and pathological brain aging. 50\% of all
              known miRNAs are found in brain including cortex and hippocampus.
              A significant number of expressed miRNAs were differentially
              regulated during aging, implicating miRNAs as regulators of brain
              aging. The ability of miRNAs to regulate multiple targets within
              a pathway or even multiple pathways allows for coordinated
              regulation of brain functions. miRNA-mediated, brain functional
              changes are evident in cognition, inflammation, neuroprotection,
              lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and lifespan.
              Dysregulation of brain miRNAs contributes to accelerated
              cognitive decline and increased neurological disorders.
              Elucidating mechanisms by which miRNAs and their multiple targets

              problem. The relative importance of genes and environment in the
              causation of nuclear cataracts, the most common form of
              age-related cataracts, is not known. METHODS: We studied 506
              pairs of female twins (226 monozygotic and 280 dizygotic) who
              were 50 to 79 years old (mean, 62). The amount of nuclear
              cataract in the right and left eyes was determined objectively by
              analysis of Scheimpflug lens photographs (yielding three
              measures) and subjectively with use of the Oxford Clinical
              Cataract Classification and Grading System (yielding one
              measure). All eight measures (four in each eye) were subsequently
              combined in one summary measure of nuclear cataract for each
              woman. A univariate maximum-likelihood model was used to estimate
              the variance of the genetic and environmental contributions to
              each of the measures. RESULTS: The different measures of cataract
              formation were highly correlated (correlation coefficients, 0.71
              to 0.94). The mean scores were similar for the right and left
              eyes and for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Quantitative
              genetic modeling of each of the nuclear-cataract scores
              invariably resulted in a best-fitting model that involved
              additive genetic effects, unique environmental effects, and age.
              The common environmental and dominant genetic effects could be
              removed from the models without significant loss of fit. The
              overall heritability in the combined nuclear-cataract score (the
              proportion of the variance explained by genetic factors) was 48
              percent (95 percent confidence interval, 42 to 54 percent); age
              accounted for 38 percent of the variance (95 percent confidence
              interval, 31 to 44 percent) and unique environmental effects for
              14 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 18 percent).
              CONCLUSIONS: Genetic effects are important even in such a clearly
              age-related disease as nuclear cataract, explaining almost 50

              aging in both dividing and nondividing cells. Functional studies
              in model organisms and humans indicate that epigenetic changes
              have a huge influence on the aging process. These epigenetic
              changes occur at various levels, including reduced bulk levels of
              the core histones, altered patterns of histone posttranslational
              modifications and DNA methylation, replacement of canonical
              histones with histone variants, and altered noncoding RNA
              expression, during both organismal aging and replicative
              senescence. The end result of epigenetic changes during aging is
              altered local accessibility to the genetic material, leading to
              aberrant gene expression, reactivation of transposable elements,
              and genomic instability. Strikingly, certain types of epigenetic
              information can function in a transgenerational manner to
              influence the life span of the offspring. Several important
              conclusions emerge from these studies: rather than being
              genetically predetermined, our life span is largely
              epigenetically determined; diet and other environmental
              influences can influence our life span by changing the epigenetic
              information; and inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes can influence
              life span of model organisms. These new findings provide better
              understanding of the mechanisms involved in aging. Given the
              reversible nature of epigenetic information, these studies

              vivo cell senescence. I proposed that the length of telomeric
              DNA, located at the ends of chromosomes consists of repeated
              sequences, which play a buffer role and should diminish in
              dividing normal somatic cells at each cell doubling. I also

              Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through

              chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease
              susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did
              not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study,
              rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased
              survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis
              conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend
              lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms
              of ageing, or both. To our knowledge, these are the first results
              to demonstrate a role for mTOR signalling in the regulation of
              mammalian lifespan, as well as pharmacological extension of
              lifespan in both genders. These findings have implications for
              further development of interventions targeting mTOR for the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Projections of future mortality and life expectancy
              are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions.
              Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life
              expectancy using an approach that takes into account the
              uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model. METHODS:
              We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which
              probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We
              applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030
              in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics
              data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life
              expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying
              before age 70 years, with life table methods. FINDINGS: Life
              expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a
              probability of at least 65\% for women and 85\% for men. There is
              a 90\% probability that life expectancy at birth among South
              Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 86·7 years, the same as
              the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57\%
              probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected
              female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in
              France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95\%
              probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South
              Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030,
              and a greater than 27\% probability that it will surpass 85
              years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece,
              Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life
              expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life
              expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in
              every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is
              predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in
              Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar
              gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy
              at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65
              years. INTERPRETATION: There is more than a 50\% probability that
              by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year
              barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn
              of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in
              longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and
              social services and pensions. FUNDING: UK Medical Research

              notably declining globally in a number of organisms and tissues
              across taxa. However, little is known about the mechanisms or the
              biological relevance for this change. We investigated the network
              of genes that controls miRNA transcription and processing during
              C. elegans aging. We found that miRNA biogenesis genes are highly
              networked with transcription factors and aging-associated miRNAs.
              In particular, miR-71, known to influence life span and itself
              up-regulated during aging, represses alg-1/Argonaute expression
              post-transcriptionally during aging. Increased ALG-1 abundance in
              mir-71 loss-of-function mutants led to globally increased miRNA
              expression. Interestingly, these mutants demonstrated widespread
              mRNA expression dysregulation and diminished levels of
              variability both in gene expression and in overall life span.
              Thus, the progressive molecular decline often thought to be the
              result of accumulated damage over an organism's life may be
              partially explained by a miRNA-directed mechanism of

               unusually high proportions of longlived individuals have been
               observed. For these areas (Ogliastra in Sardinia, Okinawa in
               Japan, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica and the island of
               Ikaria in Greece). The term of 'blue zone' (BZ) given to these
               areas is defined as a limited region where the population shares
               a common lifestyle and environment and whose exceptional
               longevity has been accurately verified. This paper discusses the
               use of different indexes to measure the longevity of a
               population. As a preliminary result of our investigations we
               confirm the exceptional level of male longevity in the Sardinian
               BZ and both male and female longevity in Okinawa. Considering
               possible explanations, we observed that BZ populations are
               geographically and/or historically isolated (islands and
               mountainous regions). These populations succeeded in maintaining
               a traditional lifestyle implying an intense physical activity
               that extends beyond the age of 80, a reduced level of stress and
               intensive family and community support for their oldest olds as

              associations with mortality generally diminish with age. How this
              pattern arises is, however, not understood. With meta-analysis we
              show that human leucocyte telomere length (TL) predicts

              modest heritability. Age-related phenotypes with higher
              heritability may have greater success in gene discovery.
              Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for
              longevity have had only limited success to date. The Cohorts for
              Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium
              conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS data for longevity, defined as
              survival to age 90 years or older, that identified several
              interesting associations but none achieved genome-wide
              significance. A recent GWAS of longevity conducted in the Leiden
              Longevity Study identified the ApoE E4 isoform as deleterious to
              longevity that was confirmed in an independent GWAS of long-lived
              individuals of German descent. Notably, no other genetic loci for

               capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human

              nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical
              inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased
              nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of
              age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and
              neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span

              in gene expression across different regions of the brain. We
              analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 to
              101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors
              of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After
              accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding
              factors, we identified 1446 protein-coding genes whose expression
              in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age
              at a false discovery rate of 5\%. These genes are involved in
              various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing,
              amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The
              distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven,
              suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found
              that the aging response of many genes, e.g., TP37 and C1QA,
              depends on individuals' genotypic backgrounds. Finally, using
              dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL7R,
              MS4A4E, and TERF1/TERF2 whose expressions are differentially
              dispersed by aging, i.e., variances differ between age groups.
              Our results demonstrate that age-related gene expression is brain
              region-specific, genotype-dependent, and associated with both
              mean and dispersion changes. Our findings provide a foundation

              Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression
              across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and
              dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis
              and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using
              identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40\% of the
              total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for
              by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution
              of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to
              both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility.
              We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression
              heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify
              several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a
              tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of
              many genes.",

              developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and
              neurodegeneration. The ageing process is deleterious for fitness,
              but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining
              force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to
              extrinsic hazards to survival: ageing can then occur as a
              side-effect of accumulation of mutations that lower fitness at
              later ages, or of natural selection in favour of mutations that
              increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher
              subsequent rate of ageing. Once thought of as an inexorable,
              complex and lineage-specific process of accumulation of damage,
              ageing has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show
              strong evolutionary conservation. Lowered activity of the

              Mitochondrial activity can also promote ageing, while genome
              maintenance and autophagy can protect against it. We discuss the

              production of predominantly deleterious alleles, a matter of
              concern from a human-health perspective. Here, recently
              established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic
              disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of
              spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of
              inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although
              the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on
              a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is
              lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with
              data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias
              toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that

              at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately

              Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current

              modulation of genes in the insulin-signaling pathway, known to
              alter nutrient sensing, has been shown to extend lifespan in
              various species. In Drosophila, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and
              the insulin pathways have emerged as major regulators of growth
              and size. Hence we examined the role of TOR pathway genes in
              regulating lifespan by using Drosophila. We show that inhibition
              of TOR signaling pathway by alteration of the expression of genes
              in this nutrient-sensing pathway, which is conserved from yeast
              to human, extends lifespan in a manner that may overlap with
              known effects of dietary restriction on longevity. In Drosophila,
              TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex genes 1 and 2) act
              together to inhibit TOR (target of rapamycin), which mediates a
              signaling pathway that couples amino acid availability to S6
              kinase, translation initiation, and growth. We find that
              overexpression of dTsc1, dTsc2, or dominant-negative forms of

              substantially different gene profile changes with age. For
              example, comparing equally powered groups, 5,029 probe sets were
              significantly altered with age in the superior-frontal gyrus,
              compared with 1,110 in the entorhinal cortex. Prominent change
              occurred in the sixth to seventh decades across cortical regions,
              suggesting that this period is a critical transition point in
              brain aging, particularly in males. Second, clear gender
              differences in brain aging were evident, suggesting that the

              only in development but also in later life. Globally across all
              brain regions, males showed more gene change than females.
              Further, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that different
              categories of genes were predominantly affected in males vs.

              disease (AD) and related tauopathies and is a crucial factor in
              the pathogenesis of these disorders. Though diverse kinases have
              been implicated in tau phosphorylation, protein phosphatase 2A
              (PP2A) seems to be the major tau phosphatase. Using murine
              primary neurons from wild-type and human tau transgenic mice, we
              show that the antidiabetic drug metformin induces PP2A activity
              and reduces tau phosphorylation at PP2A-dependent epitopes in
              vitro and in vivo. This tau dephosphorylating potency can be
              blocked entirely by the PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and
              fostriecin, confirming that PP2A is an important mediator of the
              observed effects. Surprisingly, metformin effects on PP2A
              activity and tau phosphorylation seem to be independent of AMPK
              activation, because in our experiments (i) metformin induces PP2A
              activity before and at lower levels than AMPK activity and (ii)
              the AMPK activator AICAR does not influence the phosphorylation
              of tau at the sites analyzed. Affinity chromatography and
              immunoprecipitation experiments together with PP2A activity
              assays indicate that metformin interferes with the association of
              the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) to the so-called
              MID1-$\alpha$4 protein complex, which regulates the degradation

  abstract = "It is now well established that the genomic landscape of DNA
              methylation (DNAm) gets altered as a function of age, a process
              we here call 'epigenetic drift'. The biological, functional,
              clinical and evolutionary significance of this epigenetic drift,
              however, remains unclear. We here provide a brief review of
              epigenetic drift, focusing on the potential implications for
              ageing, stem cell biology and disease risk prediction. It has
              been demonstrated that epigenetic drift affects most of the
              genome, suggesting a global deregulation of DNAm patterns with
              age. A component of this drift is tissue-specific, allowing
              remarkably accurate age-predictive models to be constructed.
              Another component is tissue-independent, targeting stem cell
              differentiation pathways and affecting stem cells, which may
              explain the observed decline of stem cell function with age.
              Age-associated increases in DNAm target developmental genes,
              overlapping those associated with environmental disease risk
              factors and with disease itself, notably cancer. In particular,
              cancers and precursor cancer lesions exhibit aggravated age DNAm
              signatures. Epigenetic drift is also influenced by genetic
              factors. Thus, drift emerges as a promising biomarker for
              premature or biological ageing, and could potentially be used in
              geriatrics for disease risk prediction. Finally, we propose, in
              the context of human evolution, that epigenetic drift may
              represent a case of epigenetic thrift, or bet-hedging. In
              summary, this review demonstrates the growing importance of the
              'ageing epigenome', with potentially far-reaching implications
              for understanding the effect of age on stem cell function and
              differentiation, as well as for disease prevention.",

  abstract = "Genome-wide studies of aging have identified subsets of genes
              that show age-related changes in expression. Although the types
              of genes that are age regulated vary among different tissues and
              organisms, some patterns emerge from these large data sets.
              First, aging is associated with a broad induction of stress
              response pathways, although the specific genes and pathways
              involved differ depending on cell type and species. In contrast,
              a wide variety of functional classes of genes are downregulated
              with age, often including tissue-specific genes. Although the
              upregulation of age-regulated genes is likely to be governed by
              stress-responsive transcription factors, questions remain as to
              why particular genes are susceptible to age-related
              transcriptional decline. Here, we discuss recent findings showing
              that splicing is misregulated with age. While defects in splicing
              could lead to changes in protein isoform levels, they could also
              impact gene expression through nonsense-mediated decay of
              intron-retained transcripts. The discovery that splicing is
              misregulated with age suggests that other aspects of gene
              expression, such as transcription elongation, termination, and
              polyadenylation, must also be considered as potential mechanisms
              for age-related changes in transcript levels. Moreover, the
              considerable variation between genome-wide aging expression
              studies indicates that there is a critical need to analyze the
              transcriptional signatures of aging in single-cell types rather
              than whole tissues. Since age-associated decreases in gene
              expression could contribute to a progressive decline in cellular
              function, understanding the mechanisms that determine the aging

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that gene
              expression levels change with age. These changes are hypothesized
              to influence the aging rate of an individual. We analyzed gene
              expression changes with age in abdominal skin, subcutaneous
              adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines in 856 female twins
              in the age range of 39-85 years. Additionally, we investigated
              genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to
              understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters
              with age. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, differential
              expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188
              genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in
              lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age.
              Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with
              expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem
              brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related
              gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed
              differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue
              and three common to adipose and brain tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Skin
              showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the
              tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously
              implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity,
              cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related
              changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only
              a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues.
              More research is needed to improve our understanding of the
              genetic influences on aging and the relationship with age-related
              diseases.",

              subterranean, extraordinarily long-lived eusocial mammal.
              Although it is the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds
              30 years, making this animal the longest-living rodent. Naked
              mole rats show negligible senescence, no age-related increase in
              mortality, and high fecundity until death. In addition to delayed
              ageing, they are resistant to both spontaneous cancer and
              experimentally induced tumorigenesis. Naked mole rats pose a
              challenge to the theories that link ageing, cancer and redox
              homeostasis. Although characterized by significant oxidative
              stress, the naked mole rat proteome does not show age-related
              susceptibility to oxidative damage or increased ubiquitination.
              Naked mole rats naturally reside in large colonies with a single
              breeding female, the 'queen', who suppresses the sexual maturity
              of her subordinates. They also live in full darkness, at low
              oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations, and are unable to
              sustain thermogenesis nor feel certain types of pain. Here we
              report the sequencing and analysis of the naked mole rat genome,
              which reveals unique genome features and molecular adaptations
              consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness
              and insensitivity to low oxygen, and altered visual function,
              circadian rythms and taste sensing. This information provides
              insights into the naked mole rat's exceptional longevity and
              ability to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low
              oxygen. The extreme traits of the naked mole rat, together with
              the reported genome and transcriptome information, offer
              opportunities for understanding ageing and advancing other areas
              of biological and biomedical research.",

              largely unknown. The bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus is the
              longest-lived mammal known, with an estimated maximal lifespan in
              excess of two hundred years. It is also one of the two largest
              animals and the most cold-adapted baleen whale species. Here, we
              report the first genome-wide gene expression analyses of the
              bowhead whale, based on the de novo assembly of its
              transcriptome. Bowhead whale or cetacean-specific changes in gene
              expression were identified in the liver, kidney and heart, and
              complemented with analyses of positively selected genes. Changes
              associated with altered insulin signaling and other gene
              expression patterns could help explain the remarkable longevity
              of bowhead whales as well as their adaptation to a lipid-rich

              adaptations of the bowhead whale, naked mole rat and Brandt's
