              diseases. Model organism studies have shown that genetic and
              chemical perturbations can extend both lifespan and healthspan.
              Aging is a complex process, with parallel and interacting
              mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for
              the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its
              effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we
              adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover
              drugs that could combat aging in human brain. Using multiple geneÂ 
              expression data sets from brain tissue, taken from patients of
              different ages, we first identified the expression changes that
              characterize aging. Then, we compared these changes in gene
              expression with drug-perturbed expression profiles in the
              Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly
              associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as antiaging
              drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during
              aging, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The
              drugs that we identified included significant number of already
              identified prolongevity drugs, indicating that the method can
              discover de novo drugs that meliorate aging. The approach has the
              advantages that using data from human brain aging data, it
              focuses on processes relevant in human aging and that it is
              unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for aging

              20-99 years. Perspectives on global gene changes that are
              associated with brain aging emerged, revealing two overarching
              concepts. First, different regions of the forebrain exhibited
              substantially different gene profile changes with age. For
              example, comparing equally powered groups, 5,029 probe sets were
              significantly altered with age in the superior-frontal gyrus,
              compared with 1,110 in the entorhinal cortex. Prominent change
              occurred in the sixth to seventh decades across cortical regions,
              suggesting that this period is a critical transition point in
              brain aging, particularly in males. Second, clear gender
              differences in brain aging were evident, suggesting that the
              brain undergoes sexually dimorphic changes in gene expression not
              only in development but also in later life. Globally across all
              brain regions, males showed more gene change than females.
              Further, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that different
              categories of genes were predominantly affected in males vs.
              females. Notably, the male brain was characterized by global
              decreased catabolic and anabolic capacity with aging, with
              down-regulated genes heavily enriched in energy production and
              protein synthesis/transport categories. Increased immune
              activation was a prominent feature of aging in both sexes, with
              proportionally greater activation in the female brain. These data
              open opportunities to explore age-dependent changes in gene
              expression that set the balance between neurodegeneration and
              compensatory mechanisms in the brain and suggest that this

              perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical

              changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in
              early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this
              pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in

              However, humans display a 3-5 times faster evolutionary rate in

              Such accelerated evolution of human brain developmental patterns

              can best be addressed at the systems level. Here we examined the
              modular structure of the protein-protein interaction (PPI)
              networks during fruitfly and human brain aging. In both networks,
              there are two modules associated with the cellular proliferation
              to differentiation temporal switch that display opposite
              aging-related changes in expression. During fly aging, another
              couple of modules are associated with the oxidative-reductive
              metabolic temporal switch. These network modules and their
              relationships demonstrate (1) that aging is largely associated
              with a small number, instead of many network modules, (2) that
              some modular changes might be reversible and (3) that genes

              tissues is a major contributor to aging and age-related diseases.
              Recently, a new class of drugs termed senolytics were
              demonstrated to extending healthspan, reducing frailty and
              improving stem cell function in multiple murine models of aging.
              To identify novel and more optimal senotherapeutic drugs and
              combinations, we established a senescence associated
              $\beta$-galactosidase assay as a screening platform to rapidly
              identify drugs that specifically affect senescent cells. We used
              primary Ercc1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblasts with reduced DNA
              repair capacity, which senesce rapidly if grown at atmospheric
              oxygen. This platform was used to screen a small library of
              compounds that regulate autophagy, identifying two inhibitors of
              the HSP90 chaperone family as having significant senolytic
              activity in mouse and human cells. Treatment of Ercc1 -/â mice, a
              mouse model of a human progeroid syndrome, with the HSP90
              inhibitor 17-DMAG extended healthspan, delayed the onset of
              several age-related symptoms and reduced p16INK4a expression.
              These results demonstrate the utility of our screening platform
              to identify senotherapeutic agents as well as identified HSP90
              inhibitors as a promising new class of senolytic drugs.The

              skin occurring due to cumulative exposure to ultraviolet
              radiation. Chronological and photoaging both have clinically
              differentiable manifestations. Various natural and synthetic

              of them have shown histological and clinical improvement, but
              most of the studies have been carried out in patients presenting
              with photoaged skin. Amongst the retinoids, tretinoin possibly is

              regulate gene transcription in numerous cells and tissues by
              binding to nuclear retinoid receptor proteins, which act as
              transcription factors. Much of the research conducted on retinoid
              signalling in the nervous system has focussed on developmental
              effects in the embryonic or early postnatal brain. Here, we
              review the increasing body of evidence indicating that retinoid
              signalling plays an important role in the function of the mature
              brain. Components of the metabolic pathway for retinoids have
              been identified in adult brain tissues, suggesting that
              all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can be synthesized in discrete
              regions of the brain. The distribution of retinoid receptor
              proteins in the adult nervous system is different from that seen
              during development; and suggests that retinoid signalling is
              likely to have a physiological role in adult cortex, amygdala,
              hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and associated brain regions.
              A number of neuronal specific genes contain recognition sequences
              for the retinoid receptor proteins and can be directly regulated
              by retinoids. Disruption of retinoid signalling pathways in
              rodent models indicates their involvement in regulating synaptic
              plasticity and associated learning and memory behaviours.
              Retinoid signalling pathways have also been implicated in the
              pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and
              depression. Overall, the data underscore the likely importance of
              adequate nutritional Vitamin A status for adult brain function

              Pharmacological inhibitors of cell-cycle progression may
              therefore have value in the treatment of neurodegenerative
              diseases in humans. GW8510 is a 3' substituted indolone that was
              developed recently as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2
              (CDK2). We found that GW8510 inhibits the death of cerebellar
              granule neurons caused by switching them from high potassium (HK)
              medium to low potassium (LK) medium. Although GW8510 inhibits
              CDK2 and other CDKs when tested in in vitro biochemical assays,
              when used on cultured neurons it only inhibits CDK5, a
              cytoplasmic CDK that is not associated with cell-cycle
              progression. Treatment of cultured HEK293T cells with GW8510 does
              not inhibit cell-cycle progression, consistent with its inability

              also examined the effectiveness of other 3' substituted indolone

              inhibit topoisomerase I and generate DNA double-strand breaks
              during replication. Here we studied the effects of CPT on the
              stability and expression dynamics of human RecQ helicases. In the
              cells treated with CPT, we observed distinct effects on WRN
              compared to other human RecQ helicases. CPT altered the cellular
              localization of WRN and induced its degradation by a
              ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. WRN knockdown cells as
              well as CPT treated cells became senescent and stained positive
              for senescence-associated $\beta$-galactosidase at a higher
              frequency compared to control cells. However, the senescent
              phenotype was attenuated by ectopic expression of WRN suggesting
              functional implication of WRN degradation in CPT treated cells.
              Approximately 5-23\% of breast cancer tumors are known to respond
              to CPT-based chemotherapy. Interestingly, we found that the
              extent of CPT-induced WRN degradation correlates with increasing
              sensitivity of breast cancer cells to CPT. The abundance of WRN
              decreased in CPT-treated sensitive cells; however, WRN remained
              relatively stable in CPT-resistant breast cancer cells. In a

              and topoisomerase I expression correlate with an aggressive tumor

              WRN abundance along with CPT-induced degradation could be a

              C. elegans, 33 of which also increased resistance to oxidative
              stress. Many of these compounds are drugs approved for human use.
              Enhanced resistance to oxidative stress was associated primarily
              with compounds that target receptors for biogenic amines, such as
              dopamine or serotonin. A pharmacological network constructed with
              these data reveal that lifespan extension and increased stress
              resistance cluster together in a few pharmacological classes,
              most involved in intercellular signaling. These studies identify
              compounds that can now be explored for beneficial effects on
              aging in mammals, as well as tools that can be used to further
              investigate the mechanisms underlying aging in C. elegans.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that gene
              expression levels change with age. These changes are hypothesized
              to influence the aging rate of an individual. We analyzed gene
              expression changes with age in abdominal skin, subcutaneous
              adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines in 856 female twins
              in the age range of 39-85 years. Additionally, we investigated
              genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to
              understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters
              with age. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, differential
              expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188
              genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in
              lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age.
              Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with
              expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem
              brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related
              gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed
              differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue
              and three common to adipose and brain tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Skin
              showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the
              tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously
              implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity,
              cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related
              changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only
              a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues.

              Such expression reversals could imply loss of cellular identity
              in the aging brain, and provide a link between aging-related
              molecular changes and functional decline. Here we analyzed 19
              brain transcriptome age-series datasets, comprising 17 diverse
              brain regions, to investigate the ubiquity and functional
              properties of expression reversal in the human brain. Across all
              19 datasets, 25 genes were consistently up-regulated during
              postnatal development and down-regulated in aging, displaying an
              ``up-down'' pattern that was significant as determined by random
              permutations. In addition, 113 biological processes, including
              neuronal and synaptic functions, were consistently associated

              and 23 control brain donors. We found that AD is accompanied by
              significant changes in the expression of many genes with
              upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and in
              transcription regulation and downregulation of genes involved in
              neuronal functions. The changes with healthy aging involved
              multiple genes but were not as strong. Replicating and
              strengthening previous reports, we find a highly significant
              overlap between genes changing expression with age and those
              changing in AD, and we observe that those changes are most often
              in the same direction. This result supports an overlap between
              the biological processes of normal aging and susceptibility to AD
              and suggests that age related genes expression changes might
              increase the risk of developing AD.",

  author   = "Niccoli, Teresa and Partridge, Linda",
  abstract = "Age is the main risk factor for the prevalent diseases of
              developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and
              neurodegeneration. The ageing process is deleterious for fitness,
              but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining
              force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to
              extrinsic hazards to survival: ageing can then occur as a
              side-effect of accumulation of mutations that lower fitness at
              later ages, or of natural selection in favour of mutations that
              increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher
              subsequent rate of ageing. Once thought of as an inexorable,
              complex and lineage-specific process of accumulation of damage,
              ageing has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show
              strong evolutionary conservation. Lowered activity of the
              nutrient-sensing insulin/insulin-like growth factor/Target of
              Rapamycin signalling network can extend healthy lifespan in
              yeast, multicellular invertebrates, mice and, possibly, humans.
              Mitochondrial activity can also promote ageing, while genome
              maintenance and autophagy can protect against it. We discuss the
              relationship between evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of
              ageing and disease, and the associated scientific challenges and
              opportunities.",

              variation tends to track environmental conditions, with societies

              reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER ('Side Effect
              Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and
              ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs,
              5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of

              mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold

              slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent

              Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that
              genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures.
              We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects
              temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This
              effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and

              DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm

              Caenorhabditis elegans, have uncovered numerous genes involved in
              aging, many conserved in mammals. However, which of these encode
              proteins suitable for drug targeting is unknown. To investigate
              this question, we screened a library of compounds with known
              mammalian pharmacology for compounds that increase C. elegans

              C. elegans, 33 of which also increased resistance to oxidative
              stress. Many of these compounds are drugs approved for human use.
              Enhanced resistance to oxidative stress was associated primarily
              with compounds that target receptors for biogenic amines, such as
              dopamine or serotonin. A pharmacological network constructed with

              are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions.
              Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life
              expectancy using an approach that takes into account the
              uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model. METHODS:
              We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which
              probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We
              applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030
              in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics
              data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life
              expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying
              before age 70 years, with life table methods. FINDINGS: Life
              expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a
              probability of at least 65\% for women and 85\% for men. There is
              a 90\% probability that life expectancy at birth among South
              Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 86Â·7 years, the same as
              the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57\%
              probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected
              female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in
              France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95\%
              probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South
              Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030,
              and a greater than 27\% probability that it will surpass 85
              years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece,
              Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life
              expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life
              expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in
              every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is
              predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in
              Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar
              gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy
              at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65
              years. INTERPRETATION: There is more than a 50\% probability that
              by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year
              barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn
              of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in
              longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and

              speculations about the upper limits of human longevity on
              observations of past trends in mortality. Here the estimate of
              the upper bound is based on hypothesized reductions in current
              mortality rates necessary to achieve a life expectancy at birth
              from 80 to 120 years and an expectation of life at age 50 from 30
              to 70 years. With the use of conditional probabilities of death
              from complete life tables for the United States, reductions in
              mortality required to achieve extreme longevity (that is, 80 to
              120 years) were compared with those resulting from hypothetical
              cures for all cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease,
              diabetes, and cancer. Results indicate that in order for life
              expectancy at birth to increase from present levels to what has
              been referred to as the average biological limit to life (age
              85), mortality rates from all causes of death would need to
              decline at all ages by 55\%, and at ages 50 and over by 60\%.
              Given that hypothetical cures for major degenerative diseases
              would reduce overall mortality by 75\%, it seems highly unlikely
              that life expectancy at birth will exceed the age of 85.",

              is increasing, whether most of these extra years are spent in
              good health is unclear. This information would be crucial to both
              contain health-care costs and increase labour-force participation
              for older people. We investigated inequalities in life
              expectancies and healthy life years (HLYs) at 50 years of age for
              the 25 countries in the EU in 2005 and the potential for
              increasing the proportion of older people in the labour force.
              METHODS: We calculated life expectancies and HLYs at 50 years of
              age by sex and country by the Sullivan method, which was applied
              to Eurostat life tables and age-specific prevalence of activity
              limitation from the 2005 statistics of living and income
              conditions survey. We investigated differences between countries
              through meta-regression techniques, with structural and
              sustainable indicators for every country. FINDINGS: In 2005, an
              average 50-year-old man in the 25 EU countries could expect to
              live until 67.3 years free of activity limitation, and a woman to
              68.1 years. HLYs at 50 years for both men and women varied more
              between countries than did life expectancy (HLY range for men:
              from 9.1 years in Estonia to 23.6 years in Denmark; for women:
              from 10.4 years in Estonia to 24.1 years in Denmark). Gross
              domestic product and expenditure on elderly care were both
              positively associated with HLYs at 50 years in men and women
              (p<0.039 for both indicators and sexes); however, in men alone,
              long-term unemployment was negatively associated (p=0.023) and
              life-long learning positively associated (p=0.021) with HLYs at
              50 years of age. INTERPRETATION: Substantial inequalities in HLYs
              at 50 years exist within EU countries. Our findings suggest that,
              without major improvements in population health, the target of
              increasing participation of older people into the labour force

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Projections of future mortality and life expectancy
              are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions.
              Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life
              expectancy using an approach that takes into account the
              uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model. METHODS:
              We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which
              probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We
              applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030
              in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics
              data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life
              expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying
              before age 70 years, with life table methods. FINDINGS: Life
              expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a
              probability of at least 65\% for women and 85\% for men. There is
              a 90\% probability that life expectancy at birth among South
              Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 86Â·7 years, the same as
              the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57\%
              probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected
              female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in
              France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95\%
              probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South
              Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030,
              and a greater than 27\% probability that it will surpass 85
              years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece,
              Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life
              expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life
              expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in
              every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is
              predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in
              Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar
              gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy
              at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65
              years. INTERPRETATION: There is more than a 50\% probability that
              by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year
              barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn
              of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in
              longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and

               unusually high proportions of longlived individuals have been
               observed. For these areas (Ogliastra in Sardinia, Okinawa in
               Japan, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica and the island of
               Ikaria in Greece). The term of 'blue zone' (BZ) given to these
               areas is defined as a limited region where the population shares
               a common lifestyle and environment and whose exceptional
               longevity has been accurately verified. This paper discusses the
               use of different indexes to measure the longevity of a
               population. As a preliminary result of our investigations we
               confirm the exceptional level of male longevity in the Sardinian
               BZ and both male and female longevity in Okinawa. Considering
               possible explanations, we observed that BZ populations are
               geographically and/or historically isolated (islands and
               mountainous regions). These populations succeeded in maintaining
               a traditional lifestyle implying an intense physical activity
               that extends beyond the age of 80, a reduced level of stress and
               intensive family and community support for their oldest olds as
               well as the consumption of locally produced food. This is likely
               to have facilitated the accumulation of ideal conditions capable
               of limiting the factors that negatively impact on health in most
               Western populations. These people experienced the

               benefits of the traditional lifestyle and those of modernity
               (increased wealth, better medical care). All these factors could

              likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages will
              continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach
              levels above 95 unless there is a fundamental change in our

              much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of most health
              problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there
              have been some reductions in the prevalence of physical
              disability and dementia. At the same time, the prevalence of
              disease has increased markedly, in large part due to treatment

                on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured
                variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal

                tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from
                such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a
                powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
                (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives
                its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that
                share common biological function, chromosomal location, or
                regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several
                cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.
                Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity
                between two independent studies of patient survival in lung
                cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA
                method is embodied in a freely available software package,
                together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined
                gene sets.",

                Here, we conducted a study on primary skin fibroblasts isolated
                from 16 species of mammals and maintained under identical cell
                culture conditions. We developed a pipeline for obtaining
                species-specific ortholog sequences, profiled gene expression by
                RNA-seq and small molecules by metabolite profiling, and
                identified genes and metabolites correlating with species
                longevity. Cells from longer lived species up-regulated genes
                involved in DNA repair and glucose metabolism, down-regulated
                proteolysis and protein transport, and showed high levels of
                amino acids but low levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and
                lysophosphatidylethanolamine. The amino acid patterns were
                recapitulated by further analyses of primate and bird
                fibroblasts. The study suggests that fibroblast profiling
                captures differences in longevity across mammals at the level of
                global gene expression and metabolite levels and reveals pathways
                that define these differences.",
