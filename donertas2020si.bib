  abstract = "This protocol details the steps for data quality assessment and
              control that are typically carried out during case-control
              association studies. The steps described involve the
              identification and removal of DNA samples and markers that
              introduce bias. These critical steps are paramount to the success
              of a case-control study and are necessary before statistically
              testing for association. We describe how to use PLINK, a tool for
              handling SNP data, to perform assessments of failure rate per
              individual and per SNP and to assess the degree of relatedness
              between individuals. We also detail other quality-control
              procedures, including the use of SMARTPCA software for the
              identification of ancestral outliers. These platforms were
              selected because they are user-friendly, widely used and
              computationally efficient. Steps needed to detect and establish a
              disease association using case-control data are not discussed
              here. Issues concerning study design and marker selection in
              case-control studies have been discussed in our earlier
              protocols. This protocol, which is routinely used in our labs,
              should take approximately 8 h to complete.",

              structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between
              chemistry-based resources. In the past, the creation and
              maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several
              chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts
              by each of the separate teams. These efforts were complicated by
              the different data models, release schedules, and differing
              business rules for compound normalization and identifier
              nomenclature that exist across the organization. UniChem, a
              large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with
              pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from
              all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of
              efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these
              links. Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to
              and from all other sources are automatically calculated and
              immediately available for all to use. Updated mappings are
              immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the
              sources. Web services in UniChem provide users with a single
              simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their
              resource to all other sources represented in UniChem. In
              addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage
              allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which
              are obsolete. Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to
              allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort.
              Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI
              has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider
              selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra
              cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for

              tumour in addition to the germline variants in their inherited
              genome. Although variants in protein-coding regions have received
              the most attention, numerous studies have noted the importance of
              non-coding variants in cancer. Moreover, the overwhelming
              majority of variants, both somatic and germline, occur in
              non-coding portions of the genome. We review the current
              understanding of non-coding variants in cancer, including the
              great diversity of the mutation types--from single nucleotide
              variants to large genomic rearrangements--and the wide range of
              mechanisms by which they affect gene expression to promote
              tumorigenesis, such as disrupting transcription factor-binding
              sites or functions of non-coding RNAs. We highlight specific case
              studies of somatic and germline variants, and discuss how
              non-coding variants can be interpreted on a large-scale through
              computational and experimental methods.",

              measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted

              cost. The availability of electronic health records (EHRs) for
              data mining offers the opportunity to discover disease
              associations and comorbidity patterns from the clinical history
              of patients gathered during routine medical care. This opens the
              need for analytical tools for detection of disease comorbidities,
              including the investigation of their underlying genetic basis.
              Results: We present comoRbidity, an R package aimed at providing
              a systematic and comprehensive analysis of disease comorbidities
              from both the clinical and molecular perspectives. comoRbidity
              leverages from (i) user provided clinical data from EHR databases
              (the clinical comorbidity analysis) and (ii) genotype-phenotype
              information of the diseases under study (the molecular
              comorbidity analysis) for a comprehensive analysis of disease
              comorbidities. The clinical comorbidity analysis enables
              identifying significant disease comorbidities from clinical data,
              including sex and age stratification and temporal directionality
              analyses, while the molecular comorbidity analysis supports the
              generation of hypothesis on the underlying mechanisms of the
              disease comorbidities by exploring shared genes among disorders.
              The open-source comoRbidity package is a software tool aimed at
              expediting the integrative analysis of disease comorbidities by
              incorporating several analytical and visualization functions.

              We developed a model in which a latent causal variable mediates
              the genetic correlation; trait 1 is partially genetically causal
              for trait 2 if it is strongly genetically correlated with the
              latent causal variable, quantified using the genetic causality
