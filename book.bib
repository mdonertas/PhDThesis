  abstract = "Aging is the largest risk factor for a variety of noncommunicable
              diseases. Model organism studies have shown that genetic and
              chemical perturbations can extend both lifespan and healthspan.
              Aging is a complex process, with parallel and interacting
              mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for
              the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its
              effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we
              adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover
              drugs that could combat aging in human brain. Using multiple gene
              expression data sets from brain tissue, taken from patients of
              different ages, we first identified the expression changes that
              characterize aging. Then, we compared these changes in gene
              expression with drug-perturbed expression profiles in the
              Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly
              associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as antiaging
              drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during
              aging, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The
              drugs that we identified included significant number of already
              identified prolongevity drugs, indicating that the method can
              discover de novo drugs that meliorate aging. The approach has the
              advantages that using data from human brain aging data, it
              focuses on processes relevant in human aging and that it is
              unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for aging
              studies.",

  abstract = "Increasing human life expectancy has posed increasing challenges
              for healthcare systems. As people age, they become more
              susceptible to chronic diseases, with an increasing burden of
              multimorbidity, and the associated polypharmacy. Accumulating
              evidence from work with laboratory animals has shown that ageing
              is a malleable process that can be ameliorated by genetic and
              environmental interventions. Drugs that modulate the ageing
              process may delay or even prevent the incidence of multiple
              diseases of ageing. To identify novel, anti-ageing drugs, several
              studies have developed computational drug-repurposing strategies.
              We review published studies showing the potential of current
              drugs to modulate ageing. Future studies should integrate current
              knowledge with multi-omics, health records, and drug safety data
              to predict drugs that can improve health in late life.",
